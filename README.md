## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter 3.0+
- **State Management**: Provider
- **HTTP Client**: Dio
- **Navigation**: GoRouter
- **Local Storage**: SharedPreferences
- **UI Components**: Material Design 3
- **Theme**: Custom theme with light/dark mode support

## Platform Support

This app supports the following platforms:

- **Android** (mobile)
- **iOS** (mobile, requires Mac with Xcode)
- **Windows** (desktop)
- **Web** (Chrome, Edge, etc.)

You can build and run the app on any of these platforms. See below for platform-specific setup.

## Fonts & Assets

- Uses **Roboto Flex** as the primary font for a modern, readable UI.
- Ensure the `assets/fonts/` directory contains the Roboto Flex font files (see `pubspec.yaml` for details).
- Asset folders (e.g., `assets/images/`, `assets/icons/`) must exist, even if empty, to avoid build errors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.0 or higher ([Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install))
- Dart SDK 2.19 or higher
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Android SDK (for Android)
- Xcode (for iOS, Mac only)
- Visual Studio with Desktop C++ workload (for Windows)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd loyalty-white-label-mobile
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   .\setup_env.ps1
   
   # Or manually copy the example file
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then edit `.env` file to configure:
   - `APP_NAME`: Your app name
   - `API_BASE_URL`: Your Loyalty Engine API server URL
   - `API_TIMEOUT`: API request timeout in milliseconds
   - Feature flags and other settings

4. **Enable desired platforms:**
   - **Android:**
     ```bash
     flutter create --platforms=android .
     ```
   - **iOS (on Mac):**
     ```bash
     flutter create --platforms=ios .
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     flutter create --platforms=windows .
     ```
   - **Web:**
     ```bash
     flutter create --platforms=web .
     ```

5. **Run the app:**
   - **Android:**
     ```bash
     flutter run -d android
     ```
   - **iOS:**
     ```bash
     flutter run -d ios
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     flutter run -d windows
     ```
   - **Web:**
     ```bash
     flutter run -d chrome
     ```
### Flutter Debug
Checks if the code is clean and follows best practices.
`flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` 

Formats the code to follow the best practices.
`flutter format .`

Runs the tests.
`flutter test`

Runs the linter.
`flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos`

Builds the app for the selected platform.
`flutter build apk --release`

Runs the app on the selected platform.
`flutter run -d android`

Cleans the project.
`flutter clean`

Gets the dependencies.
`flutter pub get`

Checks the project for any issues.
`flutter doctor`

Upgrades the project to the latest version.
`flutter upgrade`

Downgrades the project to the latest version.
`flutter downgrade`

Runs the app on the selected platform.
`flutter run -d chrome --verbose`

Roboto Flex font files must be present in `assets/fonts/` and referenced in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
fonts:
  - family: RobotoFlex
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoFlex-Regular.ttf
      - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoFlex-Bold.ttf
      - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoFlex-Italic.ttf
```

If you change fonts, update both the font files and the theme configuration in `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart`.

### Asset Folders

Ensure these folders exist (even if empty):
- `assets/fonts/`
- `assets/images/`
- `assets/icons/`

### Environment Variables

The app uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file based on `env.example`:

```bash
# App Configuration
APP_NAME=Loyalty Mobile App
APP_VERSION=1.0.0

# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
API_TIMEOUT=30000

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS=true
ENABLE_QR_CODE=true

# Development
DEBUG_MODE=true
```

**Important:** The `.env` file is ignored by git for security. Each developer should create their own local copy.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing platform error:** If you see errors like `This application is not configured to build on the web`, run the appropriate `flutter create --platforms=... .` command for your platform.
- **Missing font or asset errors:** Ensure all asset folders exist and the Roboto Flex font files are present as described above.
- **Android toolchain issues:** Run `flutter doctor` and follow the instructions to install missing SDK components or accept licenses.
- **iOS build issues:** Must be on a Mac with Xcode installed. Run `sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app` if you have multiple Xcode versions.
- **Windows build issues:** Ensure Visual Studio with Desktop C++ workload is installed.
